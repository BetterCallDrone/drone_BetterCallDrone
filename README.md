<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
drone_bettercalldrone = { git = "https://github.com/BetterCallDrone/drone_BetterCallDrone.git" }
```

## Debug
We provide detailed debugging with color-coded emphasis to highlight key events and processes, here are some examples:

<p style="font-family:consolas">
<span style="color:magenta">[BCDRONE #11]</span><span style="color:green"> Successfully spawned and started</span><br>
<span style="color:magenta">[BCDRONE #11]</span> (1:1) | <span style="color:yellow">Received</span> -> <span style="color:cyan">Message</span> | {packet}<br>
<span style="color:magenta">[BCDRONE #11]</span> (1:1) | <span style="color:green">Forwarded</span> -> <span style="color:red">Nack</span> | {packet}<br>
<span style="color:magenta">[BCDRONE #11]</span> (1:1) | <span style="color:red">SentNack through SC</span> -> <span style="color:red">Dropped</span> | {packet}<br>
<span style="color:magenta">[BCDRONE #11]</span><span style="color:cyan"> Received Crash Command from SC</span><br>
<span style="color:magenta">[BCDRONE #11]</span><span style="color:cyan"> Received Crash Command from SC</span><br>
<span style="color:magenta">[BCDRONE #11]</span> <span style="color:green">Finished handling packets</span>, <span style="color:red">Drone Crashed successfully</span><br>
<span style="color:magenta">[BCDRONE #11]</span> <span style="color:cyan">AddSender</span> -> <span style="color:green">Successfully added sender id:</span> 12<br>
</p>

### Usage in PowerShell
To activate debugging, set the `BCD_DEBUG` environment variable in your command line:

```powershell
$env:BCD_DEBUG=1; cargo run
```

To deactivate debugging, clear the `BCD_DEBUG` variable:

```powershell
$env:BCD_DEBUG=$null
```

### Usage in Other CLI Tools

To activate debugging, set the `BCD_DEBUG` environment variable in your command line:

```shell
BCD_DEBUG=1 cargo run
```
